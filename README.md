# TTV ad-block

Chrome/Firefox extension that _should?_ block ads on Twitch.

For security, this extension uses the minimum amount of permissions possible, and [the code](https://github.com/odensc/ttv-ublock/blob/extension/background.js) is as simple as possible.

The extension should install! Enjoy. Don't delete the extension folder or it will be uninstalled.

## Firefox installation

Unfortunately Firefox doesn't allow for direct installation via the source code from GitHub, so I have to distribute a signed file from Mozilla. The code is unmodified and you can verify it as such.

1. Download the XPI extension file: https://github.com/odensc/ttv-ublock/releases/download/firefox/ttv_ad_block-1.0.0-fx.xpi
2. A popup will open. Click Continue Installation. [**Image Example**](https://i.imgur.com/uCx0pie.png)
3. Click Add. [**Image example**](https://i.imgur.com/FcdWXHU.png)

The extension should install! You may need to restart your browser. Enjoy.
